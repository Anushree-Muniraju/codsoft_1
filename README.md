At CodSoft, where I pursued my internship, I have received a chance to work on three different AI-based projects which indeed honed my skills in developing intelligent systems. First, the project on a rule-based chatbot definitely provided the opportunity to generate automated responses using predefined rules, enhancing my understanding in natural language processing and user interaction. The second project was the TIC-TAC-TOE AI, where I had to implement some algorithms for strategic decisions and game theory. Finally, there was a recommender system in which I applied collaborative filtering to suggest items according to user preferences. These projects gave me great experience with AI development and strengthened my understanding of machine learning algorithms more fully.
